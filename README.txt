School project for AST 304 - Stellar Physics at Michigan State university - Fall 2014.

Utilizing Python math libraries and functions for bisection method and first order 
differential equations, the possible pressure, mass, and radius of white dwarf
stars are computed. 

Plots of the simulated data are generated, including data for Luminosity v Radius,
log-log of luminosity and effective temperature, log-log of central density and
central temperature, and temperature as a function of the radius.

Due to how long detached from the development process of this program, an error that 
causes too many iterations is unaddressed and the program currently doesn't work properly.
When time allows and other project commitments do not interfere, I will likely attempt to 
correct the issue.

For the time being, the plots from the last time it compiled correctly are provided and 
serve to illustrate the intended outcome of the program.
